                        <p>
                            The real motivation behind Andromeida were people like you, who love water as much as we do.
                            Straight from our heart came India’s first pool cleansing robotic platform in 2021, which
                            won an unparalleled support from all our partners in innovation and our continued passion to
                            serve the ocean better, has finally led us to the induction of this Unmanned Underwater
                            Robot to the Andromeida family. We are delighted to bring you the UUR (available in 2
                            versions and pronounced as ‘Your’) - A customisable and assistive underwater robot to make
                            your observation and analytics, easier than ever.

                        Our connection with NIOT (Ministry of Earth Sciences), as mentioned earlier, is a cornerstone of
                        our R&D collaboration. Winning the NIOT tender for AUV control systems has positioned Andromeida
                        as a go-to private player for specialized underwater projects. Through this, we contribute to
                        national projects like the Deep Ocean Mission by providing our expertise in robotics and AI.

                            <p>
                                We started by addressing a community need – keeping swimming pools clean and safe. Our
                                first product, Pool Buddy™, is an autonomous pool-cleaning robot that uses a patented
                                disinfection method to maintain healthy pools . This project, which aligned with UN Blue
                                Economy goals of water quality , earned us a government R&D grant for innovation in
                                2020. Pool Buddy proved our capability to build rugged underwater systems and even
                                introduced a Robot-as-a-Service model for pool maintenance . After successful pilots
                                (and delighting pool owners with algae-free pools), Pool Buddy is currently being
                                upgraded as we refine its cleaning stack to bring a completely hassle-free solution to
                                pool management and cleaning.

                                important for you to know than us and hence we began taking complimentary lectures for
                                students and aspirants who loved underwater robotics and were aimed at making a career
                                therein. This initiative evolved as another segment, AndroLearn, and therefore

                                from fabrication to assembly and testing of customised thrusters of UUR, Andromeida’s
                                lab in Bengaluru offers a wholesome assembly and fabrication experience to any client
                                interested to customise his/her academic or industrial UUR. The UUR is available in 2
                                versions, namely UUR-Acad and UUR-Quest. The ‘Acad’ version is optimized for
                                universities, labs, and student training purposes. It is cost-effective and highly
                                modular, making every building block of underwater robots accessible to educational
                                institutes and research groups on a budget. Whereas, UUR-Quest is an expedition-grade

                    For Researchers & Marine Professionals: Andromeida offers a unique value proposition – a
                    customizable, research-grade underwater robot built to your needs. Instead of one-size-fits-all, we
                    give you flexibility. You get the reliability of a commercial system and the openness of a DIY
                    project. With UUR, marine scientists can undertake surveys, inspections, and experiments with
                    professional efficacy, while enjoying the freedom to modify and upgrade the robot as science
                    advances. Our dedicated support, including training sessions and technical assistance, ensures you
                    make the most of your UUR from day one. The result is faster discoveries, richer data, and a
                    capability that sets your lab or organization apart. As one of our early adopters noted,
                    “Andromeida’s UUR empowered our team to collect Critical data in weeks that would have otherwise
                    taken
                    months”. It truly puts you in control, aligning with what other industry leaders highlight –
                    providing data-centric solutions and efficiency gains for ocean operations . 36 37 For Investors:
                    Investing in Andromeida means backing a company that is at the intersection of multiple high-growth

                <p>
                    Being a startup that “loves to co-create compelling solutions”, we are agile and creative . Our
                    engineers are continuously experimenting with new ideas, whether it’s improving underwater
                    communication or developing AI algorithms for sonar image recognition. For instance, AquaSee – our
                    AI-based image enhancement pipeline – was developed entirely in-house to help researchers get
                    clearer imagery in turbid waters . Innovations like these not only add value to our products but
                    also further the state of the art in underwater robotics. 19 4 By developing everything at home, we
                    not only ensure that our solutions are cost-effective and tailored to local needs, but we also build
                    intellectual capital within India. We collaborate with local suppliers and talent, boosting the tech
                    ecosystem. Each robot or tool we make in our facility is a step towards a more self-reliant marine
                    tech industry. Quality, innovation, and self-reliance – that’s the Andromeida way.
