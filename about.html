                        <p>
                            To optimize propulsion, we built a thrust measurement stand that evaluates each thruster’s
                            output thrust vs. power consumption. This allows us to fine-tune motor controllers and
                            propeller designs for maximum efficiency. When a thruster is mounted on UUR, we know exactly
                            how it will perform under various loads and voltages – translating to reliable performance
                            in the field. Investors and partners can be confident that every specification we quote is
                            backed by empirical testing.

                        <h3>Pressure Chamber</h3>
                        <p>
                            Underwater robots must endure high pressures; even a small leak can be
                            mission-ending. Our in-house pressure chamber simulates deep-sea pressure conditions. We
                            test UUR hulls and seals to find the cracking pressure – the point at which structural
                            integrity would fail – and ensure it far exceeds normal operating pressures. This rigorous
                            testing guarantees that our robots can dive with confidence. It also enables us to certify
                            custom enclosures for any new payloads or batteries that a client might want to add to UUR.

                                We started by addressing a community need – keeping swimming pools clean and safe. Our
                                first
                                product, Pool Buddy™, is an autonomous pool-cleaning robot that uses a patented

                                method to maintain healthy pools . This project, which aligned with UN Blue Economy
                                goals of
                                water quality , earned us a government R&D grant for innovation in 2020. Pool Buddy
                                proved
                                our capability to build rugged underwater systems and even introduced a
                                Robot-as-a-Service
                                model for pool maintenance . After successful pilots (and delighting pool owners with
                                algae-free pools), Pool Buddy is currently being upgraded as we refine its cleaning
                                stack to
                                bring a completely hassle-free solution to pool management and cleaning.

                <p>
                    Being a startup that “loves to co-create compelling solutions”, we are agile and creative . Our
                    engineers are continuously experimenting with new ideas, whether it’s improving underwater
                    communication or developing AI algorithms for sonar image recognition. For instance, AquaSee – our
                    AI-based image enhancement pipeline – was developed entirely in-house to help researchers get
                    clearer imagery in turbid waters . Innovations like these not only add value to our products but
                    also further the state of the art in underwater robotics. 19 4 By developing everything at home, we
                    not only ensure that our solutions are cost-effective and tailored to local needs, but we also build
                    intellectual capital within India. We collaborate with local suppliers and talent, boosting the tech
                    ecosystem. Each robot or tool we make in our facility is a step towards a more self-reliant marine
                    tech industry. Quality, innovation, and self-reliance – that’s the Andromeida way.
